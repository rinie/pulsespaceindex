Technical data for the external sensor:
- Temperature measuring range/accuracy:       -20 to +65°C (-4 to +149°F) / ±1.5 °C (± 2.7 °F)
- Relative humidity measuring range/accuracy: 20 to 99% / ± 5%
- Relative humidity resolution:               1%
- Transmission frequencies:                   433 MHz (ch1:~433919300,ch2:~433915200,ch3:~433918000, various?)
- Transmission output:                        < 10 dBm / < 10 mW

The ID is retained even if the batteries are changed.
The device has three channels and a transmit button.

Data layout:
The sensor transmits 12 identical messages of 36 bits in a single package each ~60 seconds, depending on the temperature.

Biltema-Rain sensor.

Based on the springfield.c code, there is a lack of samples and data
thus the decoder is disabled by default.

- nibble[0] and nibble[1] is the id, changes with every reset.
- nibble[2] first bit is battery (0=OK).
- nibble[3] bit 1 is tx button pressed.
- nibble[3] bit 2 = below zero, subtract temperature with 1024. I.e. 11 bit 2's complement.
- nibble[3](bit 3 and 4) + nibble[4] + nibble[5] is the temperature in Celsius with one decimal.
- nibble[2](bit 2-4) + nibble[6] + nibble[7] is the rain rate, increases 25!? with every tilt of
  the teeter (1.3 mm rain) after 82 tilts it starts over but carries the rest to the next round
  e.g tilt 82 = 2 divide by 19.23 to get mm.
- nibble[8] is checksum, have not figured it out yet. Last bit is sync? or included in checksum?.

/** @fn static int xc0324_callback(r_device *decoder, bitbuffer_t *bitbuffer)
Digitech XC-0324 device.

The encoding is pulse position modulation
(i.e. gap width contains the modulation information)
- pulse is about 400 us
- short gap is (approx) 520 us
- long gap is (approx) 1000 us

Deciphered using two transmitters.

A transmission package is 148 bits
(plus or minus one or two due to demodulation or transmission errors).

Each transmission contains 3 repeats of the 48 bit message,
with 2 zero bits separating each repetition.

A 48 bit message consists of:
- byte 0: preamble (for synchronisation), 0x5F
- byte 1: device id
- byte 2 and the first nibble of byte 3: encodes the temperature
    as a 12 bit integer,
    transmitted in least significant bit first order
    in tenths of degree Celsius
    offset from -40.0 degrees C (minimum temp spec of the device)
- byte 4: constant (in all my data) 0x80
    _maybe_ a battery status ???
- byte 5: a check byte (the XOR of bytes 0-4 inclusive)
    each bit is effectively a parity bit for correspondingly positioned bit
    in the real message

This decoder is associated with a tutorial entry in the
rtl_433 wiki describing the way the transmissions were deciphered.
See https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/wiki/digitech_xc0324.README.md

The tutorial is "by a newbie, for a newbie", ie intended to assist newcomers
who wish to learn how to decipher a new device, and develop a rtl_433 device
decoder from scratch for the first time.

To illustrate stages in the deciphering process, this decoder includes some
debug style trace messages that would normally be removed. Specifically,
running this decoder with debug level :
- `-vvv` simulates what might be seen early in the deciphering process, when
    only the modulation scheme and parameters have been discovered,
- `-vv` simulates what might be seen once the synchronisation/preamble and
    message length has been uncovered, and it is time to start work on
    deciphering individual fields in the message,
    with no debug flags set provides the final (production stage) results,
    and
- `-vvvv` is a special "finished development" output.  It provides a file of
        reference values, to be included with the test data for future
        regression test purposes.

/**
Globaltronics Quigg BBQ GT-TMBBQ-05.

BBQ thermometer sold at Aldi (germany)
Simple device, no possibility to select channel. Single temperature measurement.

The temperature is transmitted in Fahrenheit with an addon of 90. Accuracy is 10 bit. No decimals.
One data row contains 33 bits and is repeated 8 times. Each followed by a 0-row. So we have 16 rows in total.
First bit seem to be a static 0. By ignoring this we get nice byte boundaries.
Next 8 bits are static per device (even after battery change)
Next 8 bits contain the lower 8 bits of the temperature.
Next 8 bits are static per device (even after battery change)
Next 2 bits contain the upper 2 bits of the temperature
Next 1 bit is unknown
Next 1 bit is an odd parity bit
Last 4 bits are the sum of the preceeding 5 nibbles (mod 0xf)

Here's the data I used to reverse engineer, more sampes in rtl_test

 * Protocol Description
 * ________________________________
 * Bits 00 to 02 are a 976 ms RF front porch pulse, providing a wake up period that allows the
 *      system controller receiver to synchronize with the incoming packet.
 * Bits 3 to 14 include 12 sync pulses, e.g., logical 0's, to synchronize the receiver.
 * Bit 15 is a start pulse, e.g., a logical 1, that tells the receiver that data is to follow.
 * Bits 16-58 provide information regarding the transmitter and associated sensor. In other
 *      embodiments, bits 16-58 may be replaced by an analog signal.
 * Bits 16 to 35 provide a 20-bit sensor identification code that uniquely identifies the particular
 *      sensor sending the message. Bits 36 to 39 provide a 4 bit device-type code that identifies the
 *      specific-type of sensor, e.g., smoke, PIR, door, window, etc. The combination of the sensor
 *      bits and device bits provide a set of data bits.
 * Bits 40 through 42 provide a 3-bit trigger count that is incremented for each group of message
 *      packets. The trigger count is a simple but effective way for preventing a third party from
 *      recording a message packet transmission and then re-transmitting that message packet
 *      transmission to make the system controller think that a valid message packet is being transmitted.
 * Bit 43 provides the low battery bit.
 * Bits 44 through 53 provide the latch bit value and the debounced value for each of the five inputs
 *      associated with the transmitter. For the F5 input, both a positive and negative latch bit are provided.
 * Bit 55 provides even parity over odd bits 15 to 55.
 * Bit 56 provides odd parity over even bits 16 to 56.
 * Bit 57 is a programmable bit that can be used for a variety of applications, including providing an
 *      additional bit that could be used for the sensor identification code or device type code.
 * Bit 58 is a 366 ms RF on signal that functions as the "old" stop bit. This bit provides compatibility with
 *      prior system controllers that may be programmed to receive a 58-bit message.
 * Bit 59 is a logical 1.
 * Bits 60 to 62 are a modulus eight count of the number of 1 bits in bits 15 through 54, providing enhanced
 *      error detection information to be used by the system controller. Finally, bit 63 is the "new" stop bit,
 *      e.g., a logical 0, that tells the system controller that it is the end of the message packet.
 *
 * Addendum
 * _______________________________
 * GE/Interlogix keyfobs do not follow the documented iti protocol and it
 *     appears the protocol was misread by the team that created the keyfobs.
 *     The button states are sent in the three trigger count bits (bit 40-42)
 *     and no battery status appears to be provided. 4 buttons and a single
 *     multi-button press (buttons 1 - lock and buttons 2 - unlock) for a total
 *     of 5 buttons available on the keyfob.
 * For contact sensors, latch 3 (typically the tamper/case open latch) will
 *     float (giving misreads) if the external contacts are used (ie; closed)
 *     and there is no 4.7 Kohm end of line resistor in place on the external
 *     circuit

Proove/Nexa/Kaku decoder.
Might be similar to an x1527.
S.a. Kaku, Nexa.

Tested devices:
- Magnetic door & window sensor
  - "Proove" from 'Kjell & Company'
  - "Anslut" from "Jula"
  - "Telecontrol Plus" remote by "REV Ritter GmbH" (Germany) , model number "008341C-1"
  - "Nexa"
  - "Intertechno ITLS-16" (OEM model # "ITAPT-821")
  - Nexa - LMST-606

From http://elektronikforumet.com/wiki/index.php/RF_Protokoll_-_Proove_self_learning

Proove packet structure (32 bits or 36 bits with dimmer value):

    HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHGO CCEE [DDDD]

- H = The first 26 bits are transmitter unique codes, and it is this code that the receiver learns to recognize.
- G = Group command. Set to 1 for on, 0 for off.
- O = On/Off bit. Set to 1 for on, 0 for off.
- C = Channel bits (inverted).
- E = Unit bits (inverted). Device to be turned on or off. Unit #1 = 00, #2 = 01, #3 = 10.
- D = Dimmer value (optional).

Physical layer:
Every bit in the packets structure is sent as two physical bits.
Where the second bit is the inverse of the first, i.e. 0 -> 01 and 1 -> 10.
Example: 10101110 is sent as 1001100110101001
The sent packet length is thus 64 bits.
A message is made up by a Sync bit followed by the Packet bits and ended by a Pause bit.
Every message is repeated about 5-15 times.
Packet gap is 10 ms.

    hum num-->25-32bit(7bits) in reverse order : in this case "1001110"=78
    humidity=num-28 --> 78-28=50

I have channel number bits(5,6 in reverse order) and low battery bit(9).
It seems that the 1,2,3,4,7,8 bits changes randomly on every reset/battery change.
